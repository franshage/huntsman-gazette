                            the confines of their homes our Tailors diligently kept working, ensuring that our client’s

                            create a single bespoke garment,using the combined skill of the individuals to produce

                    <p class="dropCap">
                        Whilst many of the Huntsman team kept busy in Lockdown, for many the frustrations of
                        isolation and confinement understandably put a strain on everybody. Inspired by Nick
                        Farriella’s satirical fake letter from F. Scott Fitzgerald whilst quarantined in the South of
                        France, Huntsman’s owner Pierre Lagrange, came up with a novel idea to help alleviate the
                        onset of isolation boredom and break the rhythm of confinement with a unique competition.
                        Huntsman’s ‘Letters From Confinement’ invited you to share your words with us, whether
                        you were an already commended penman or a budding wordsmith in search of a new
                        creative outlet, we accepted hundreds of submissions from around the world.</p>

                        <p>The winner of Letters From Confinement is Mr. Shoaib Sumar, whose satirical take on
                            Huntsman during the Spanish Flu of 1919 entertained us with it’s historical accuracy. His
                            very worthy runner up, Mr Justin Li, came in a close second place, with his Ode To The
                            Lavatory, which we found to be very sophisticated toilet humour indeed.

                    Whilst many enjoyed the Huntsman Tweed competition, it bought back some nostalgia to
                    those pleasant weekends spent in the field and at the peg, and so with the shooting season
                    disrupted or put on hold indefinitely ,we offered the opportunity to test your shooting acumen
                    and keep up to scratch with the Huntsman Shooting Quiz. Presented in partnership with
                    Roxtons, with questions compiled by some of the keenest sportsmen and women, you had
                    to beat the clock with 43 brain teasers, from the top speed of grouse, to the inventor of the
                    breech loading shotgun.</p>

                            One of the trickiest things when choosing your bespoke garments, is finding the choice of
                            cloth
                            that is right for you. Fortunately, planning for this season, and indeed seasons to come,
                            our

                            worked together over lockdown to produce a collection of essential clothes for every
                            occasion to
                            wear at home, at work, as well as outdoors and different social occasions. In a Zoom
                            interview,
                            the three talk over their every choice and describe what makes this collection so special,

                            <p class="">Unable to resist a challenge, Huntsman’s Co Head Cutter, Dario Carnera, turned
                                his
                                bespoke skills to Huntsman’s largest challenge to date! The cutting and stitching of a
                                bespoke car suit, designed by internationally renowned artist and designer Ron Arad,
                                which took centre stage on display in the window of 11 Savile Row.<br> <br>
                                Inspired by the protection blankets covering cars in the street, Ron began sketching
                                what he imagined to be the cars under cover, these sketches then woven into car
                                covers. Arad collaborated with renowned car manufacturer Morgan about creating an art
                                piece to cover one of their models. <br>
                                <br>Thinking of the cover as a bespoke garment in this
                                respect, Arad approached Huntsman, as the most innovative tailor on Savile Row, to
                                stitch the cover.

                            <p>Masterfully cut and hand-stitched by Dario, it was by far his largest and most unusual
                                undertaking with Huntsman. Taking over 72 hours of skilled handwork, the size and
                                weight of the fabric required a special kind of thread- traditional cotton stitching
                                just
                                wouldn’t support. Using leather thread, Dario applied the same style of baste stitching
                                you’d expect to find on a bespoke garment, but on a much larger scale!<br><br>
                                “Of all the projects I’ve worked on, this has been by far the most challenging, but also
                                most rewarding! It was fascinating to see how translating Rons initial design into
                                canvas
                                and then into a pattern to be cut and stitched as you would a garment really brought it
                                to
                                life. Just as putting pattern to cloth requires a certain rock of eye, so too did
                                creating
                                this
                                car cover, albeit with a completely different framework! ”

                    THE FUTURE OF BESPOKE TAILORING
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Inspired by the precision of robotic surgery, Pierre Lagrange, and Head of Retail Taj Phull
                    devised a revolutionary service which transports our Cutters to your home or office without
                    leaving London or New York. Using Omnipresent technology, teleporting Bespoke Services
                    allows you to access your cutter on-demand, without the need to travel or wait.
                    Mr. Hammick is Huntsman’s first telepresence robot. Named after Huntsman’s famed Head
                    Cutter of the 1970s, notoriously the World’s best-dressed man, Mr. Hammick travels with his
                    locally based human assistant, who executes all tasks as directed live by your Cutter from
                    London or New York.
                    Your Cutter will be teleported in your room via Mr. Hammick’s screen and will control Mr.
                    Hammick remotely to maneuver around your body. They can zoom in with telescopic
                    precision, record, and photograph details of your garments during your fitting.
                    We first launched our Teleporting Bespoke Services in Asia, earlier this year, where clients
                    have already begun enjoying uninterrupted bespoke service, despite lockdown!
                    Coming at the start of 2021 Mr Hammick will be joining Ed and the team in the US, giving an
                    even greater level of availability to the team! If you’re not able to join us on one of our regular
                    trunk shows across America, you can book an appointment with Ed, Ralph and Mr Hammick
                    at your leisure.
