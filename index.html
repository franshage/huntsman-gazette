                <p class="dropCap">
                    Whilst many of the Huntsman team kept busy in Lockdown, for many the frustrations of
                    isolation and confinement understandably put a strain on everybody. Inspired by Nick
                    Farriella’s satirical fake letter from F. Scott Fitzgerald whilst quarantined in the South of
                    France, Huntsman’s owner Pierre Lagrange, came up with a novel idea to help alleviate the
                    onset of isolation boredom and break the rhythm of confinement with a unique competition.
                    Huntsman’s ‘Letters From Confinement’ invited you to share your words with us, whether
                    you were an already commended penman or a budding wordsmith in search of a new
                    creative outlet, we accepted hundreds of submissions from around the world.</p>

                        You can now enjoy the work of all of our finalists but it was two entries that stood out in

                        Huntsman during the Spanish Flu of 1919 entertained us with it’s historical accuracy. His
                        very worthy runner up, Mr Justin Li, came in a close second place, with his Ode To The
                        Lavatory, which we found to be very sophisticated toilet humour indeed.

                        Like all good tweed designs, Amy took inspiration
                        from that which she knew and loved in nature, to
                        create a tweed evocative of country pursuits from

                        <p class="">Unable to resist a challenge, Huntsman’s Co Head Cutter, Dario Carnera, turned his
                            bespoke skills to Huntsman’s largest challenge to date! The cutting and stitching of a
                            bespoke car suit, designed by internationally renowned artist and designer Ron Arad,
                            which took centre stage on display in the window of 11 Savile Row.<br> <br>
                            Inspired by the protection blankets covering cars in the street, Ron began sketching
                            what he imagined to be the cars under cover, these sketches then woven into car
                            covers. Arad collaborated with renowned car manufacturer Morgan about creating an art
                            piece to cover one of their models. <br>
                            <br>Thinking of the cover as a bespoke garment in this
                            respect, Arad approached Huntsman, as the most innovative tailor on Savile Row, to
                            stitch the cover.

                            undertaking with Huntsman. Taking over 72 hours of skilled handwork, the size and
                            weight of the fabric required a special kind of thread- traditional cotton stitching just
                            wouldn’t support. Using leather thread, Dario applied the same style of baste stitching
